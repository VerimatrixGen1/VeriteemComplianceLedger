# Installation
Veriteem Compliance Ledger is an application which runs on top of Veriteem.  Currently, only Linux Ubuntu 16.04LTS is supported.  However, the Veriteem is deployed and accessed with Python3, and thus Windows and MacOS may be supported in the near future.

Installing Veriteem Compliance Ledger is a two step process:
* pip3 install veriteemcomplianceledger
* VeriteemConfig.py

The Veriteem Compliance Ledger may be accessed through the Veriteem command line interface:
* VeriteemCL.py

Detailed installation and troubleshooting guides may be found [here](https://github.com/VerimatrixGen1/VeriteemComplianceLedger/wiki/Detailed-Installation-and-Troubleshooting)

# Overview
The Veriteem Compliance Ledger provides application specific access to Distributed Ledgers running over the Veriteem Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).  Veriteem  ***TBD add link*** in turn is an Ethereum Fork which provides a publicly readable ledger with multiple levels of write access with Proof of Authority consensus.  The ledger is managed by a group of Ledger Guardians, who provide the transaction processing, Proof of Authority consensus, and management of Smart Contracts running on the ledger.

The Veriteem Compliance Ledger framework is used to provide device information from manufacturers and compliance organizations to network and ecosystem operators.  The information includes compliance status, firmware update links, operating instructions, and expected network behavior.  This information is provided in a machine readable interface for use by onboarding/installer tools, gateways, and backend systems.

The access control to the ledger is managed within the Veriteem Distributed Ledger Technology.  Please refer to the Veriteem Access Control section for more information about how this is managed for the ledger applications that make up the Veriteem Compliance Ledger.

# System Contracts
The Compliance Ledger contains a set of contracts which are written by compliance organizations, and contracts which are written by the device manufacturer.

Device data is indexed by either a ComplianceID, which is derived from data provided by a the device, or ModelID, which is randomly generated by the manufacturer.  Each compliance organization's contract provides a means to convert data provided by the device to a ComplianceID, which is then used to read the ModelID from the compliance record.  The ModelID may then be used to read manufacturer supplied data, or read other compliance organization's records as they may apply to the device.
